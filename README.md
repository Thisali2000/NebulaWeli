## Payment Plan Validation

The payment plan system now includes comprehensive validation for installment plans to ensure data integrity and accuracy.

### Installment Validation Features

#### 1. Real-time Validation
- **Client-side validation**: As users enter installment amounts, the system calculates totals and compares them against the course fees
- **Visual feedback**: The table footer shows running totals and required amounts
- **Mismatch indicators**: Clear warnings when installment totals don't match course fees

#### 2. Server-side Validation
- **Backend validation**: All installment data is validated on the server before saving
- **Detailed error messages**: Specific error messages showing the difference between totals and required amounts
- **Floating-point precision**: Uses tolerance of 0.01 for floating-point comparisons

#### 3. Auto-completion Feature
- **Smart suggestions**: When the remaining amount is less than 10% of the total fee, an auto-complete button appears
- **One-click completion**: Automatically distributes remaining amounts to the last non-empty installment
- **User-friendly**: Helps users quickly complete installment plans without manual calculations

#### 4. Validation Rules
